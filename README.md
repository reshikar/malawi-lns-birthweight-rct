# Malawi LNS vs IFA Randomized Controlled Trial

Randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of maternal lipid-based nutrient supplementation (LNS) on neonatal birth weight in Malawi, analyzed using log-binomial and linear regression models in SAS.
## Study Background
Low birth weight (<2500g) remains a major contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings. While iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation is standard prenatal care, lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) provide additional macronutrients and micronutrients that may improve fetal growth.This study compares LNS versus IFA in improving birth weight outcomes
## Study Design
- Individually randomized, parallel-group RCT  
- Allocation ratio: 1:1 (LNS vs IFA)  
- Participants: Pregnant women ≤20 weeks gestation  
- Setting: Rural health centers in Malawi  
- Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis  
## Outcomes
Primary Outcomes:
- Low birth weight (<2500g), binary
- Mean birth weight (grams), continuous
## Statistical Methods
- Log-binomial regression to estimate Risk Ratios (RR)
- Identity-link binomial model for Risk Differences (RD)
- Linear regression for mean birth weight differences
- Interaction models to assess effect modification by maternal BMI
- Analyses conducted in SAS
## Key Findings
- LNS reduced the risk of low birth weight (RR ≈ 0.50)
- LNS increased mean birth weight by approximately 100 grams
- No statistically significant effect modification by maternal BMI
## Public Health Implications
Findings support the potential role of maternal LNS supplementation in reducing low birth weight in undernourished populations and strengthening antenatal nutrition programs in resource-limited settings.
